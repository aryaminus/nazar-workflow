1 Label the images by bulk renaming images inside the folder with the respective folder name

2 Copy all .jpg files to a single folder using
    ```
    $ find . -type f \( -iname "*.jpg" -o -iname "*.jpeg" \) -exec cp '{}' /cpjpg \;
    ```
    This will copy all files ending in .jpg or .jpeg (case insensitive as well) in the current directory and all its subdirectories to the directory /cpjpg. The directory structure is not copied.

3 Duplicate the directory

3 Open the newly duplicated directory and rename .jpg to .jpg.txt
    ```
    $ rename .jpg .jpg.txt *.jpg
    $ truncate -s 0 *.jpg.txt
    ```
