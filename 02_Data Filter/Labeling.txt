1 Label the images by bulk renaming images inside the folder with the respective folder name

2 Copy all .jpg files to a single folder using
    ```
    find . -type f \( -iname "*.jpg" -o -iname "*.jpeg" \) -exec cp '{}' /cpjpg \;
    ```
    This will copy all files ending in .jpg or .jpeg (case insensitive as well) in the current directory and all its subdirectories to the directory /cpjpg. The directory structure is not copied.
