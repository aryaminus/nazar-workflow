1) Clone Multi-label-Inception-net
    ```
    $ https://github.com/BartyzalRadek/Multi-label-Inception-net
    ```

2) Open Multi-label-Inception-net

3)  Put all the training images into one folder inside images directory ie from the .jpg containing directory
    Try to remove all duplicate images, they could atificially inflate the test and validation accuracy.
    The name of the folder does not matter. I use multi-label.

4) Copy the *.jpg.txt files to image_labels_dir directory or change the path to this folder by editing global variable IMAGE_LABELS_DIR in retrain.py 

5) 

6) Create file labels.txt in project root and fill it with all the possible labels. Each label on a new line, nothing else. Just like an image_label file for an image that is in all the possible classes.

    For shortcut:
    ```
    find ./ -type f -name '*[!0-9][0][0][1].jpg.txt'
    ```
        - gives you a list of files as ./file001.jpg.txt
        - Copy them and then replace thr ./ and 001.jpg.txt

7) We now have all the images inside one directory and therefore the image_lists.keys() contains only one element and that is the folder with all of our images (e.g. multi-label). All the training images are split into validation, testing and training sets accessible through this key.
