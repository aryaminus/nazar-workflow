Gather and Label Pictures:

TensorFlow needs hundreds of images of an object to train a good detection classifier. To train a robust classifier, the training images should have random objects in the image along with the desired objects, and should have a variety of backgrounds and lighting conditions.
Make sure the images aren’t too large. They should be less than 200KB each, and their resolution shouldn’t be more than 720x1280. The larger the images are, the longer it will take to train the classifier. You can use the resizer.py script in this repository to reduce the size of the images.
