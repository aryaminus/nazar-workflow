A “labels” map indicating the labels and their indexes is required. This is how they look.

```
item {
  id: 1
  name: 'Pikachu'
}
```
    Replace the “Pikachu” label with yours, and important, always start with index 1 because 0 is reserved. I saved this file as object-detection.pbtxtin a new directory named “training”.
